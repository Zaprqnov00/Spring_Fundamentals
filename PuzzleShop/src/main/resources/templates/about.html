        <p class="h3">The first jigsaw puzzle was created by a map engraver called John Spilsbury,
            in 1762. He mounted one of his master maps onto wood and then cut around the countries.
            He gave it to children in the local school to help them with their geography education.
            And in that act jigsaw puzzles were invented.Jigsaw puzzles are perhaps the most popular form of puzzle.
            Jigsaw puzzles were invented around 1760, when John Spilsbury, a British engraver and cartographer,
            mounted a map on a sheet of wood, which he then sawed around the outline of each individual country on the map.
            He then used the resulting pieces as an aid for the teaching of geography.
